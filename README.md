Hi this is the python code and casefiel for the paper named "Title: Explainable Data-driven Hybrid Power Flow Model in Distribution Networks: A Tree-based Approach".
Run AIPFerrorfor33 or AIPFerrorfor141 to test results in these two systems. Some small changes to the code maybe required if other systems are tested.
